    <br>
    I already learned of my past projects in HTML, Arduino and other programming languages that I have to name my files right. I often just saved pictures as "jadhsjdhsds" or something like this. 
    <br>
    Projects were named like "Project 1, Project 2,...". I changed this and often name my files right. I can get better everytime and I want to improve myself.
    <br>
    Mistakes and problems can be really frustrating but u learn a lot of them. I realize that my website doesnt look like a professional website. But maybe I will startover and design it completly different.
    <br>
    I found a really amazing <a href="https://theyearofgreta.com/" target="_blank">website</a> while searching for ideas for my website. It even is political and I support the message of the website.
    <br>
    I am sure, I will never create a website as good as this website. But I want to create something like <a href="https://www.templatemonsterpreview.com/demo/51928.html" target="_blank">this</a> would be amazing. This is a huge difference when I compare it with this website.
    <br>
    I really want to make my website phone compatible next time. Also I have to better name my classes or id's. I need more structure, the order of my classes and id's in my .css or .js file is really messed up sometimes.
    <br>
    I always have to remember what a class or id is for and I have to find it easily. Everything except of the CSS code for <a href="Media.html">the social media site</a> is created by myself and I dont exactly know how it works.
    <br>
    I learn with tutorials and websites/apps that explain HTML, Java Script or CSS elements. There wasnt an explanation to the code, but I want to know how this code works and understand it very soon.
    <br>
    I have huge problems with the like and dislike function of my memes page. First I had problems with clicking the like or dislike button and having changes. 
    <br>
    It saved the new number of likes, but I had to reload the page to see the new number of likes. Then I had problems with increasing the number of likes, if I click the like button first and dont change my opinion of the memes.
    <br>
    I used "likesPic1 = likesPic1++;", "likesPic1 = likesPic1 += 1;" and "likesPic1 = likesPic1 + 1;". The last two actions just added a 1 at the end to the current number of likes. Even though it doesnt with 2 or when the operator is minus.
    <br>
    The first action just increased the number of likes on the website, but didnt saved. Then I tried it again with one of the two other actions, but it never worked. After that I changed it back as it was before.
    <br>
    But now it didnt even increased the number of likes on the website. I dont know why. Sometimes everything worked fine, but after refreshing 3-5 times, it stopped working. I often thought about the variable. It could be wrong or the program thinks it is a string.
    <br>
    I just wrote "var likesPic1 = localStorage.getItem("likesPic1");", because I learned that u just write "var" in Java Script instead of the usual "int", "string", "boolean" or other types. 
    <br>
