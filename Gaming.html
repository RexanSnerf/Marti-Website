    I am playing video games now for a few years. I startet with a Playstation Portable, I bought on a market where you can buy cheap second hand stuff. In Germany it's called "Flohmarkt". I dont think this exist in other countries.
    <br>
    I think it's typical german. I played games like Star Wars, WALL-E or Gran Turismo on it. There were more games, but I dont really remember them. Then I got my first laptop.
    <br>
    This laptop was incredibly bad, I know I played an old version of "Ballerburg" in 2D and DX-BALL.
    <br>
    Then I started playing Minecraft, because I saw cool videos of it on Youtube and many of my classmates played Minecraft too.
    <br>
    I had like 2-4 fps with this laptop. Very rarely 10 or more fps. Thankfully I got a new better laptop. But the laptop was still bad. I had normally maybe 15 fps and sometimes 30 or more. If I remember it right.
    <br>
    I also started playing Roblox (Phantom Forces) on it. And tried to play Fortnite when the Fortnite hype started. It didn't worked, because I played with the worst settins and still had 0-2 fps. 
    <br>
    So I didnt continued playing. I played a lot of Paladins. Sometimes I also played Dirty Bomb or Heros & Generals.
    <br> 
    I got a Farming Simulator too someday, but I can't remember, what Farming Simulator version or if I had a laptop then or not. When I turned 14 I bought myself a PC. 
    <br>
    This PC is much better than these 2 laptops. I can play GTA 5, Battlefield 5 and other games with best settings on 140 fps or more. I am very happy with this PC.
    <br>
    The first game I played was Fortnite, and I continued playing until Chapter 2 Season 1 was getting bored. It was even a little bit bored before Chapter 2, but I kept playing because my best friend played it with my often.
    <br>
    With her it always made a lot of fun. She wasn't playing that often anymore, but I hoped she would come back. So I played only a few matches a day to get my daily bonuses. 
    <br>
    I also played Rainbow Six Siege and when I didnt played Fortnite that much anymore, I played a lot of Rainbow Six Siege. Idk when I started playing Farming Simulator again, but I played Farming Simulator 17.
    <br>
    I even played it with my best friend once, that was soo funny. We didnt really played normal, we just did weird stuff. Then I bought Farming Simulator 19. Most of the time I play alone.
    <br>
    But I also played Farming Simulator 19 with a friend. We also did weird stuff, even though we tried to play normal at the beginning.
    <br>
    I bought Farming Simulator 19 together with Ghost Recon Wildlands. I think I bought them at the beginning of summer break. I had a year when I didnt felt good. And holidays were just boring.
    <br>
    I needed a lot of entertaiment. I really played through the game during summer break. And I really like the game. But the holidays were still bad.
    <br>
    A friend, who really likes cars, recommended me Project Cars 2. We could play it together. I bought it and we played it togther sometimes. I played it alone too, but not that often.
    <br>
    I realize rn that I failed with my time managing. I wanted to start with my start as Gamer and go on to today. But it's completly messed up. But I am to lazy to start again or make it right.
    <br>
    As I said earlier, I have GTA 5 and Battlefield 5. At the moement when I am creating this website, Battlefield 5 is my favourite game. But I am disappointed of GTA 5. I doesnt make that much fun.
    <br>
    We changed our internet provider and we had 3 weeks or more no internet connection. We new we had no internet connection for a short time. 
    <br>
    So I prepared myself and bought City Skylines, Raft, Sims 4, Planet Coaster, Kingdom New Lands, ShellShock Live. I'm not sure, but maybe Transport Fever 2 too.
    <br>
    I also have CS:GO which I also played during no internet connection time, Rocket League, Rock of Ages and World of Warships. These 4 games did I also played with the friend who likes cars.
    <br>
    I have Tabletop Simulator and UNO. Lol. It is often really fun, if you dont play alone. I played it with my best friend. 
    <br>
    I think my newest games are Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Hearts of Iron 4 and VALORANT. Valorant is really famous rn, but I am not really good at it. I dont like it.
    <br>
    Ghost Recon Brealpoint make sometimes fun, but rn I dont have much time and rather play other games, because I have frustrating memoried of the game.
    <br>
    But I really like Hearts of Iron 4. It's a strategic game about the 2 World War and today (06.06.2020) I already have 393 hours fun with this game. [Thats not much when we compare it with 951 hours in Rainbow Six Siege.]
    <br>
    That are many games, lol. I could even make an Excel chart of all my games.
