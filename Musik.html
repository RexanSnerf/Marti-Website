      <section class="section"><div class="TextMittePositionieren">I started listening a lot music 2017, I used Youtube Music, because less ads. But 2018 I bought Spotify Premium and then continued on Spotify. I listened more and more music.
      <br>
      [This pictures are from my Spotify Rewind 2019.]</div></section>

      <section class="section"><br><div class="TextMittePositionieren">At the beginning I really enjoed K-Pop, specially BTS and this didnt changed to summer/autumn 2019. I also listened a lot of Pop music. But in summer I discovered German Pop and Yungblud.
      <br>
      I wouldn't call it German Pop, cause I hate almost every German Pop song. I would call it German Rock and these songs were popular so it makes sense again. Today I doesnt like "German Pop" that much anymore.
      <br>
      My "German Pop" was Die &Auml;rzte, Alligatoah, Revolverheld, Rammstein, Kraftklub, KUMMER and some other songs. I only still listen to Alligatoah and Rammstein. I also still listen to YUNGBLUD. He is amazing.
      <br>
      I cant explain myself this graph named "Rap". Some songs I listened to were rap songs. But I didnt listened to them that much.</div></section>

      <aside class="aside"><br><img class="MitteMusikBild" src="spotify2.png"></aside>
      <section class="KleinerText"><div class="kleinerTextMittePositionieren">As I said, I listened a lot of Pop music and I still do today. I even still listen to K-Pop but much less. My favourite artists were Ariana Grande and Imagine Dragons. They are still one of my favourites.
      <br>
      I liked Taylor Swift, but not anymore. I also liked and still like Dua Lipa and 5 Seconds of Summer. There was a time when I even loved Disney music and Linkin Park. But I often just listen to Linkin Park when I mad or sad.
      <br>
      The picture shows my favourite artists, favourite songs, the time I listened to music on Spotify and my favourite music genre. You can see the song "Butterfly". It is really sad.</div></section>
      <aside class="KleinesBild"><img class="MittekleinesMusikBild" src="spotify1.png"></aside>
      <footer class="Musikfooter"><br>I am not as often sad as in my  Bad Year, so I deleted every sad song in my playlist with every song I like.
      <br>
      I sill get mad sometimes, but I listen very rarely to Linkin Park. I just listen to YUNGBLUD or my "Neue Deutsche H&auml;rte" playlist.
      <br>
      Neue Deutsche H&auml;rte is a german music genre. A friend introduced me to it. I already listened to some Rammstein songs at that moment. But I didnt knew Oomph! and Eisbrecher. They make amazing music.
      <br>
      These 2 bands are my favourites at the moment. I also discovered 2 songs of Dagny, which are one of my favourite Pop songs rn. (07.06.2020)
