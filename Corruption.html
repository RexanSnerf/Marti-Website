            Corruption is not fair and not good for democracy. Decisions should be made without money deciding it.
            Not every company has the money to do that. Democracy should work with argues and not who pays the most money to politicians.
            Politicians should vote for their voters and not for their wallet.
            Corruption is disturbing the production of laws. Lobbiest are very active, its hard to know if corruption is taking place sometimes.
            There are plans for a law to register lobby work, but rn it doesnt seem like this law is going to make it.
            The CDU and the FDP were blocking a law against corruption a few years ago.
            I think these are two of the most corrupt big partys. And I am not the only one.
            Many people are criticizing that big donators like "Volswagen", "BMW", "Nestle", and much more are controling the politics to much.
            But donating isnt forbidden. Some politicians have important jobs in a company and may decide in their behavior.
            Others decide in behavior of companys and later get importants jobs in this company.
            I saw a statistic of income of politicians that showed that some politicians gained a lot of money besides their job.
            This doesnt mean that this politicians really mean that they are corrupt. But I think some of them are.
            And the politicians with the biggist not job income are many politicians of the CDU or FDP.
            You cant know If some politicians incomes influence their decisions in politics. But I think some of them do.
            I would like a register to write down the work of lobbiest, donations and income by companys of politicians.
            So should corruption be prevented and better to investigate.
            The magazin "Der Spiegel" published an article about corruption in connection with "Philipp Amthor" and the company "Augustus Intelligence". 
            He send a letter to the econamy minister to suggest to work with the company and asist the comany.
            Philipp Amthor should have got stock options and a director post by the company.
            He is not the only one who has connections to this company, for example the ex defense minister "Theodor von Guttenberg" and the ex Verfassungsschutz president "Hans-Georg Maaßen".
            But there isnt any evidence that they could have worked in their behavior.
            The scandal focusses on Philipp Amthor. I think Amthor is guilty. 
            And I think there could be more corruption in the "Bundestag". I dont like that. I want changes. I want a lobby register.
