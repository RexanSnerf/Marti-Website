            The human made climate change is an huge problem. We already can notice a little bit of it. The world is getting hotter every year.
            The nature and we humans are in danger. Biodiversity is declining, the farmers have poorer yields and more natural disasters are increasing. The deserts are getting bigger.
            This all is caused or at least speeded up by CO2 and some other chemical bindings. CO2 is produced massively by humans.
            For example coal-fired power plants, traveling, heating and much more. This is known for many years. But the politicians didnt changed a lot.
            Greta Thunberg and the organization Fridays for Future are demonstrating on Fridays instead of going to school to bring attention to this subject.
            They get a lot of hate, but they are getting bigger an bigger. They have succesfully brought more attention to the climate change. 
            Some goverments in europe reacted to the protests, but not good enough. 
            In Germany a climate package with laws has been made, the protestors criticized that this wouldnt be enough. The funny thing is, the strong car lobby pressured the goverment and the goverment changed the package.
            The climate package got worse. To be fair, later the goverment did make changes to it that made the package even better than before, but still with some important parts worse than before.
            Ursula von der Leyens "Green Deal" is a huge package with laws and a lot of money to make europe emission neutral to 2050.
            She is having a good point, she doesnt want to leave anyone behind, but its not enough, we have to get emission neutral by 2030 and we need even more money to do that.
            So the citizens have do react, we have to change a lot to slow down climate change.
            The searching platform "Ecosia" is planting with every search made 1 tree. They have so far 97.330.000 [15.06.2020] trees planted. Thats incredible.
            In Africa 20 countries are trying for 13 years now to stop the spreading of the desert by planting a forrest linie all over the continent.
            Ethopia wants to plant 20 billion trees in 4 years. That is even more incredible then the work of Ecosia. And this country isnt that rich.
            The countries want to spend 30 billion euro on planting of trees. The "UN", europe and some other private companys are already investing to help.
            But the countries in africa need more. I hope europa and the "UN" donate more. They have enough money. I also hope that other countries start donating.
            It helps the countries very much and slows not only the desert spreading down. It also slows down the climate change.
            There is also a company that cleans the ocean and rivers. It's called "The Ocean Clean Up", thats not really something against climate change. But a huge help to the enviroment and the ocean, its worth mentioning.
            I think its hard for private persons to be enviromental friendly, specially the persons who have to save money. The goverment has to create more laws to make this country more enviromental friendly.
