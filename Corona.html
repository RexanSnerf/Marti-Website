            2 1/2 months after the begin of lockdown my country was beginning to opening everything up agian. 
            I had to go with my family to a zoo. I didnt wanted to go, because I think the zoo is fucking boring. I already were there so many times.
            I thinked also of the corona virus, but I were just thinking of the bored zoo.
            When I arrived there I saw how crowded it was there. Very crowded. My sister wanted to go to the playground. So we went there.
            And most of the kids and parents didnt watched the rules to prevent the spreading of the corona virus. 
            In this zoo, there wasnt really rules, just advices. But almost everyone didnt followed them.
            It was completly chaos in my opinion. I like order, but there wasnt any order. There were soo many people.
            I was also getting mad, cause my parents were discussing weird theories about the corona virus.
            But I know, they have not much knowledge in this subject and I also know that I cant argue with them about their weird theories, cause they dont believe me.
            I did tried it once, when they believed a WhatsApp chain message. But they rather believe this chain message then me, who argues with biological and scientifc facts.
            I would never say I am a pro at this subject. But I am also one of these 80 million hobby doctors in germany. Lol.
            This may sound very arogant again, but I think I can detect false news and can argue with some facts about it pretty good.
            I am worried about the spreading of false news(I dont like to say Fake News), weird theories and the corona virus.
            2 months ago almost everyone was worried and followed the anti-corona advices and rules.
            But rn it seems like everyone is calme again and doesnt really take care of the rules and advices. 
            I hope this will change, yes we have a low number of infected people in germany, but the crisis isnt over yet.
            I also think people should check their sources and dont believe everything they hear.
            Thats exactly what (often right)people say to make their followers stop believing the arguments of their enemys.
            But thats not what I mean. I want that everyone checks their sources neutral.
            And to make this right, good education is needed.
