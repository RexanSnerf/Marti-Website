  <b id="Rexan"> aka. Rexan </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a little website with informations about myself.
  <br>
  I was born on <b>3rd of April 2004</b> in Germany, currently I am 16 years old. My real name is Martin, but my best friend calls me sometimes Marti. And I really like it. Rexan is a name
  <br>
  from a name generator. I use this name often in video games. I'm a <a href="Gaming.html">Gamer</a>, so I am single. Lol. I'm listening to <a href="musik.html">music</a> or I'm watching Youtube or Netflix while playing.
  <br>
  My political oriantation is left, I want equality, fairness, peace, less hate and much more. I like to make sport, go for a walk or ride my bike during good weather. The nature is
  <br>
  the best place to relax in my opinion. I like comedy, politics and science. My family has cats, a dog and 2 horses. I like to pet them or play with them. Sometimes I am <a href="coding.html">coding</a>.
  <br> 
  I like to be alone. So I don't have to talk to anyone. When I am alone, I can do whatever I want, without people watching my awkward stuff, judging me or whatever.
  <br>
  I can relax when I am alone. I felt very lonely for maybe a year and had some difficulties with loving myself. But I am more confident and self-loving today.
  <br>
  I don't care that much anymore what people think about me, I wouldn't say I don't care. But many things I don't care about. I am doing everything I want.
  <br>
  And I don't do stuff I dont like. Except of things with my family. I often have to go to trips with my family and I don't like it. But my parents force me to come with them. I hate it.
  <br>
  <br>
  I chose this picture of this astronaut walking on the moon looking at the earth as my profile picture on almost every social media account. I saw it as animation in a video of
  <br>
  "Daily Dose of Internet" and it amazed me. So I took a Screenshot of it. The picture shows in my opinion creativity and freedom. It also shows that science is import and
  <br>
  this person walking alone on the moon shows me that you are the most import thing. You should do, like, feel, be [and more] whatever you want.
  <br>
  Your feelings are the most important. You shouldnt be arogant and completly dont care about others, for examples refugees or these poor families in africa. I am not often very
  <br>
  creative, but creativity and to be differnt is very important. Same as freedom. Freedom is very very important. It is maybe hard to see all this differnet sides of the picture.
  <br>
  But maybe the person who sees this picture feels same as I. I want to spread this picture and I also think it really fits to me.
