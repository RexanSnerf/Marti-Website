        I am german, but I really like the english languages. Thats why I make this website on english. I would say, I can speak fluently english, but I still make stupid mistakes.
        <br>
        Just like in my last english oral exam. When I had to describe a picture I said "On the picture I can see...". I dont have many problems translating what I want to say,
        <br>
        but I have to check sometimes if I spelled it right. I really like the english language. In 5th grade I was really bad in english class and always got E's. 
        <br>
        But I got better and better because of playing video games in english and watching more and more Youtube videos in english. Rn I watch a lot of videos in english.
        <br>
        Every of my social media apps and some other apps are in english, I am watching Netflix movies in english, I am listening a lot of english music and my video games are in english. 
        <br>
        It is very import to speak english in some games to communicate with the team and explain for example where the enemy is.
        <br>
        I have huge problems with the french language. I am really bad at it. I could learn by changing the language of my apps and games to french, but I like the english language so much.
        <br>
        I would say I am a little bit lazy too. I tried to learn french with Duolingo. But after 1 month I stopped, because I often forgot it and I was too lazy.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am good in math, physics, chemestry, history, politics, english and IT class. And I think I am getting better in german class. I am ok in other classes, not bad, but also not good.
        <br>
        I think I cant really show my knowledge in some classes, but essentially in politics. Maybe I just feel good in politics and I am actually just ok.
        <br>
        I really fucked up the last politics class test. I am interested in all this topics and also work with them in my free time. Except of math and physics, I am just good at understanding it.
        <br>
        I watch a lot of scientific, journalistic, political, historical and comedie videos and documentarys. I often watch for example heute-show, Tagesschau, MaiLab,
        <br>
        MrWissen2go (-Geschichte),  Quarks, Dinge Erklärt - Kurzgesagt / Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, Y-Kollektiv, follow me.reports, Martin Sonneborn, Nico Semsrott, NDR, ZDFinfo, ARTE
        <br>
        and much more. I like to watch this videos / documenteries. I think thats pretty special. I think many people just watch Netlix or anything else, but not videos like this.
        <br>
        I also play a game called "Hearts of Iron 4" where you can learn a lot about history. It starts at 1936 and you can play the 2.World War as any country.
        <br>
        It doesnt shows everything, there is for example not a word about the Holocaust, but u can still learn a lot (if you go the historical way).
        <br>
        I think understanding the world and knowing a lot is amazing me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think am really good at organazing. I like it to have everything ordered. I also like to get my work dont very fast. Before Corona it wasnt really that way. But it changed.
        <br>
        When I got all my work done, I can better relax without thinking of homework I still have to do. Thats why I hadnt any free time for the last 3 days.
        <br>
        I still have to do my french homework, but I cant continue because I have to wait on someone else to get her work done. Now I am coding this website.
        <br>
        Thats kinda homework too, cause I will send it to my IT class teacher. But it would feel better if I would had finished all my other homeworks.
        <br>
        I am kinda mad at her, she even wanted to help and explain me an exercise, but she forgot it. In chemestry it is kinda the same.
        <br>
        My group isnt doing anything, so I finished everything alone and asked them to react to my results. One said ok, but I didnt got any kind of reaction.
        <br>
        I dont know what they think about it, I think it could be better but I dont know how. I dont even know if everything is right.
        <br>
        Guess I have to deal with that. Not everyone is as fast and productiv as I am. That is kinda arogant. But maybe I am a little bit arogant.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I have a lot of empathy, but I realise now that I can be a little bit arogant. I think I work with critics, I want to improve myself. And this would help me.
        <br>
        But I cant be entirely sure. A year or two years ago I coulnt really stay calme. Rn I think I can still calme. But when I argue with my parents I cant stay calme sometimes.
        <br>
        What I defenitly know, I am shy. But I think I am getting less shy everyday. 2 or 3 Years I was completly shy. Now I am not that shy anymore. But still a little bit.
        <br>
        I like to argue, but mostly just with friends, classmates or my family. Once a friend of my parents visited us. He is a really right person, I would even say he is a Neonazi.
        <br>
        But I think many right persons are Neonazis. He has a lot of weird opinions I dont agree on. And I wanted to argue with him, but I was too shy and scared.
        <br>
        Thats a problem, specially because I planted to become politicians. I am really struggeling with my future. I am not sure what I want to do after school.
        <br>
        <br>
        I thought about becoming politician, because I want to make changes. Make the world a better place. Argueing and making the truth more important.
        <br>
        But I dont know if I am good enough or this would be the right thing. Maybe it is just a hype, just like coding sometimes is.
        <br>
        I also thought about becoming police officer, programmer or working at the "Miniatur Wunderland" as programmer or something like that.
        <br>
        But I am not sure if these things are the right things. I think I am not good enough in every of these jobs. Of course u dont have to be perfect.
        <br>
        But u need at least some level of skills. Maybe I could also do something with my journalistic or historic knowledge.
        <br>
        I dont want to be a journalist, cause I would have to work like an asshole to get good storys, except when I would work for the "Tagesschau".
        <br>
        And I cant find a cool job about history.
