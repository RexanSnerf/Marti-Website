        I am german, but I really like the english languages. Thats why I make this website on english. I would say, I can speak fluently english, but I still make stupid mistakes.
        Just like in my last english oral exam. When I had to describe a picture I said "On the picture I can see...". I dont have many problems translating what I want to say,
        but I have to check sometimes if I spelled it right. I really like the english language. In 5th grade I was really bad in english class and always got E's. 
        But I got better and better because of playing video games in english and watching more and more Youtube videos in english. Rn I watch a lot of videos in english.
        Every of my social media apps and some other apps are in english, I am watching Netflix movies in english, I am listening a lot of english music and my video games are in english. 
        It is very import to speak english in some games to communicate with the team and explain for example where the enemy is.
        I have huge problems with the french language. I am really bad at it. I could learn by changing the language of my apps and games to french, but I like the english language so much.
        I would say I am a little bit lazy too. I tried to learn french with Duolingo. But after 1 month I stopped, because I often forgot it and I was too lazy.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am good in math, physics, chemestry, history, politics, english and IT class. And I think I am getting better in german class. I am ok in other classes, not bad, but also not good.
        I think I cant really show my knowledge in some classes, but essentially in politics. Maybe I just feel good in politics and I am actually just ok.
        I really fucked up the last politics class test. I am interested in all this topics and also work with them in my free time. Except of math and physics, I am just good at understanding it.
        I watch a lot of scientific, journalistic, political, historical and comedie videos and documentarys. I often watch for example heute-show, Tagesschau, MaiLab,
        MrWissen2go (-Geschichte),  Quarks, Dinge Erklärt - Kurzgesagt / Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, Y-Kollektiv, follow me.reports, Martin Sonneborn, Nico Semsrott, NDR, ZDFinfo, ARTE
        and much more. I like to watch this videos / documenteries. I think thats pretty special. I think many people just watch Netlix or anything else, but not videos like this.
        I also play a game called "Hearts of Iron 4" where you can learn a lot about history. It starts at 1936 and you can play the 2.World War as any country.
        It doesnt shows everything, there is for example not a word about the Holocaust, but u can still learn a lot (if you go the historical way).
        I think understanding the world and knowing a lot is amazing me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think am really good at organazing. I like it to have everything ordered. I also like to get my work dont very fast. Before Corona it wasnt really that way. But it changed.
        When I got all my work done, I can better relax without thinking of homework I still have to do. Thats why I hadnt any free time for the last 3 days.
        I still have to do my french homework, but I cant continue because I have to wait on someone else to get her work done. Now I am coding this website.
        Thats kinda homework too, cause I will send it to my IT class teacher. But it would feel better if I would had finished all my other homeworks.
        I am kinda mad at her, she even wanted to help and explain me an exercise, but she forgot it. In chemestry it is kinda the same.
        My group isnt doing anything, so I finished everything alone and asked them to react to my results. One said ok, but I didnt got any kind of reaction.
        I dont know what they think about it, I think it could be better but I dont know how. I dont even know if everything is right.
        Guess I have to deal with that. Not everyone is as fast and productiv as I am. That is kinda arogant. But maybe I am a little bit arogant.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I have a lot of empathy, but I realise now that I can be a little bit arogant. I think I work with critics, I want to improve myself. And this would help me.
        But I cant be entirely sure. A year or two years ago I coulnt really stay calme. Rn I think I can still calme. But when I argue with my parents I cant stay calme sometimes.
        What I defenitly know, I am shy. But I think I am getting less shy everyday. 2 or 3 Years I was completly shy. Now I am not that shy anymore. But still a little bit.
        I like to argue, but mostly just with friends, classmates or my family. Once a friend of my parents visited us. He is a really right person, I would even say he is a Neonazi.
        But I think many right persons are Neonazis. He has a lot of weird opinions I dont agree on. And I wanted to argue with him, but I was too shy and scared.
        Thats a problem, specially because I planted to become politicians. I am really struggeling with my future. I am not sure what I want to do after school.
        <br>
        <br>
        I thought about becoming politician, because I want to make changes. Make the world a better place. Argueing and making the truth more important.
        But I dont know if I am good enough or this would be the right thing. Maybe it is just a hype, just like coding sometimes is.
        I also thought about becoming police officer, programmer or working at the "Miniatur Wunderland" as programmer or something like that.
        But I am not sure if these things are the right things. I think I am not good enough in every of these jobs. Of course u dont have to be perfect.
        But u need at least some level of skills. Maybe I could also do something with my journalistic or historic knowledge.
        I dont want to be a journalist, cause I would have to work like an asshole to get good storys, except when I would work for the "Tagesschau".
        And I cant find a cool job about history.
