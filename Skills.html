        I am german, but I really like the english language. Thats why I make this website in english. I would say, I can speak english fluently, but I still make stupid mistakes.
        Just like in my last english oral exam. When I had to describe a picture I said "On the picture I can see...". I dont have many problems translating what I want to say,
        but I have to check sometimes if I spelled it right. When I am nervous, for example if I have to present something in english I also make very very big mistakes. I notice them, but 
        I hate myself because of that afterwards. I really like the english language. In 5th grade I was really bad in english class and always got E's. 
        But I got better and better because of playing video games in english and watching more and more Youtube videos in english. Rn I watch a lot of videos in english.
        Every of my social media apps and some other apps are in english, I am watching Netflix movies in english, I am listening a lot of english music and my video games are in english. 
        It is very import to speak english in some games to communicate with the team and explain for example where the enemy is.
        I have huge problems with the french language. I am really bad at it. I could learn by changing the language of my apps and games to french, but I like the english language so 
        much that I wouldnt like to change the language. I would say I am a little bit lazy too. I tried to learn french with Duolingo. But after 1 month I stopped, because I often 
        forgot it and I was too lazy. But now I started learning french with Duolingo again and I am more active now.

        I am good in math, physics, chemestry, history, politics, english and IT class. And I think I am getting better in german class. I am ok in other classes, not bad, but also not good.
        I think I cant really show my knowledge in some classes, but essentially in politics. Maybe I just feel good in politics and I am actually just ok.
        I really fucked up the last politics class test. I am interested in all this topics and also work with them in my free time. Except of math. I am just good at understanding it.
        I watch a lot of scientific, journalistic, political, historical, comedy videos and documentarys. I often watch heute-show, Tagesschau, MaiLab,
        MrWissen2go (-Geschichte),  Quarks, Dinge Erklärt - Kurzgesagt / Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, Y-Kollektiv, follow me.reports, Martin Sonneborn, Nico Semsrott, NDR, ZDFinfo, ARTE, Terra X Lesch & Co
        and much more. I like to watch this videos / documenteries. I think thats pretty special. I think many people just watch Netlix or anything else, but not videos like this.
        I also play a game called "Hearts of Iron 4" where you can learn a lot about history. It starts at 1936 and you can play the 2.World War as any country.
        It doesnt shows everything, there is for example not a word about the Holocaust, but u can still learn a lot (if you go the historical way).
        I think understanding the world and knowing a lot amazes me.
        <br>

        I think am really good at organazing. I like it to have everything ordered. I also like to get my work done very fast. Before Corona it wasnt really that way. But it changed.
        When I get all my work done, I can relax better without thinking of homework I still have to do. Thats why I hadnt any free time for the last 3 days.
        Now I am coding this website. Thats kinda homework too, cause I will send it to my IT class teacher.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think I have a lot of empathy, but I realise now that I can be a little bit arogant. I think I can work with critics, I want to improve myself. And this would help me.
        But I cant be entirely sure. A year or two years ago I coulnt really stay calme. Rn I think I can still calme. But when I argue with my parents I cant stay calme sometimes.
        What I defenitly know, I am shy. But I think I am getting less shy everyday. 2 or 3 Years I was completly shy. Now I am not that shy anymore. But still a little bit.
        I like to argue, but mostly just with friends, classmates, my family or in the internet(because I dont have to talk face to face and I am more anonymous). 
        Once a friend of my parents visited us. He is a really right person, I would even say he is a Neonazi.
        But I think many right persons are Neonazis. He has a lot of weird opinions I dont agree on. And I wanted to argue with him, but I was too shy and scared.
        Thats a problem, specially because I planted to become a politician. I am really struggeling with my future. I am not sure what I want to do after school.
        <br>
        <br>
        I thought about becoming politician, because I want to make changes. Make the world a better place. Argueing and making the truth more important.
        But I dont know if I am good enough or this would be the right thing. Maybe it is just a hype, just like coding sometimes is.
        I also thought about becoming police officer, scientist, <a href=Coding.html title="Click here to see my coding skills.">programmer</a> or working at the "Miniatur Wunderland" as programmer or something like that.
        But I am not sure if these things are the right things. I think I am not good enough in any of these jobs. Of course u dont have to be perfect.
        But u need at least some level of skills. Maybe I could also do something with my journalistic or historic knowledge.
        I dont want to be a journalist, cause I would have to work like an asshole to get good storys, except when I would work for the "Tagesschau".
        And I cant find a cool job about history. As scientist u have to be very smart. I feel smart sometimes, but maybe is that watching of scientific videos just
        a hobby and I am to stupid to be a scientist.
