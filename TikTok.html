            Tik Tok is one of the most popular apps. It has 1 billion downloads only in the Play Store. U can publish short videos of urself lipsinging or dancing to a song on Tik Tok.
            Memes are also very popular on Tik Tok. U can even make livestreams. It looks very similar to Instagram and has a lot of features of other apps for exanple Snapchat filter
            or the donations and livestream system of Twitch. The app is easy to understand and the users doesnt have to learn something new. Many people think Tik Tok is cool, funny 
            and entertaining, but it also has its cons. 
            <br>
            Tik Tok is not very safe if u want to protect ur data. In my opinion its even worse than Facebook. Tik Tok is allowed to use ur videos as advertisment without asking the 
            creator of the video, it tracks ur position, it reads ur phone and SIM-card number, it has access to ur phone contacts and sells ur data to other companys. 
            But the last point is kinda normal in many apps. Many datasafety experts are warning that the app may sends our data to china. The app is chinese and is subordinate to  <!--untergeordnet-->the chinese goverment. 
            The goverment wants to control everything and is censoring a lot. They want to delete violence and extremism, just like almost every app, but also political videos which 
            are against the opinion of the chinese goverment or critisize the chinese goverment. When u searched for example "Hong Kong" during the Hong Kong protests u will only find funny videos of the city. 
            Also homosexuals were and still are not welcome on Tik Tok. The company denies that, but they lie. Discrimination is taking place on Tik Tok, it reduces the range of persons who are plump,<!--dicklich--> or doenst look very beautiful.
            They doenst want to show them to many people so they cant get bullied. But in this modern world they could also get depressed because they arent getting famous and may think that they arent beautiful enough.
            This argument is very stupid in my opinion. In China doesnt exist a freedom of the press or freedom of speech. There are even concentration camps. And I dont like to support this country.
            Some of the money Tik Tok earns is going to the chinese goverment. Eventough many of my everyday products come from China, I dont want to give any money to them anymore. I dont care about most of my data, 
            but I dont like for example the tracking of my current position and some other points. I think this app and the videos on Tik Tok are fucking cringe, disgusting and stupid. 
            Rn the #Kulikitaka-Challenge ist popular because of Tik Tok, just an example because this challenge is fucking stupid.
            I dont want to support their discrimination of people who are rated by some algorithm as not beautiful or their censoring of critics against the chinese goverment. I dont want to 
            support this anti freedom chinese country.
