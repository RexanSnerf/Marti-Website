    Coding is often just a hype. I am having really fun with a coding language or HTML, but after a certain time, I am bored. 
    <br>
    I started with <b>HTML</b> because of school. I realized it made really fun and I extended my knowlegde with tutorials.
    <br>
    We continued with <b>CSS</b>, but I forgot how CSS works. I want to renew my HTML knowlegde, startover with css and <del>learn Python</del><ins> use Java Script</ins> with this project.
    <br>
    The first time I coded was with <b>Scratch 2</b>, my best project was Pong with settings. I was really proud of myself. And yes, I made Pong, cause I dont have creativity to create something new by myself.
    <br>
    After HTML and CSS we learned <b>Java Script</b>, I often just call it Java lol. My Java Editor at home is weird and I dont have any idea to create something cool with Java Script. So I didnt continued with Java Script at home.
    <br>
    I wanted to make a Discord bot for my Discord server. So I watched tutorials and created one. I made it with <b>Python</b>, but I didnt learned much, I often just copied the code of the tutorial and changed it a little bit.
    <br>
    I even bought a python book in a book store. But I never read it lol.
    <br>
    Before the quarantine time, we wanted to start with <b>Arduino</b> at school. But then came Covid-19 and we had only 1 lesson with Arduino. We only talked and made a LED blinking, so it wasnt much.
    <br>
    I bought some Arduino Starter Kits and some other stuff on Amazon. Even though I dont like to give money to this fucking rich company. Its the only and easiest way to order something in the internet for me.
    <br>
    In these Starter Kits were a lot of differnt sensors and actuators, but also a book and access to a PDF with explanations to these different hardware parts and the coding of the software. 
    <br>
    I read this book and build the projects of the book. I usually dont really read books. But during this idk 8 weeks of Lockdown I read even 3 books. 1 because of school, 1 comedy book and this Arduino book.
    <br>
    It made really fun and I continued, watched many videos of Arduino Project and build many projects. 
    <br>
    But I ordered a TFT Display, that doesnt really work, breadboards with to small pin holes (as example to put my Arduino Nano on the breadboard) and no creativity for new usefull projects. 
    <br> 
    I also accidently deleted all my sketches while reinstalling my Arduino IDE. It was really frustrating at the end. I still have some components I didnt really used. I hadnt really fun with Arduino anymore and now I make this website.
    <br> 
    I even started reading my Python book, but I start with Python later. I wanted to start installing everything I need for this project. But I have problems with Python. I am already frustrated. Nice.
    <br>
    [Update 2 days later: I realized, that this wouldnt work with Python, so I think I stop reading this book and use Java Script for this website.]
    <br>
    During this projects many <a href="Problems.html">problems</a> came up and I learned a lot. I really enjoy coding this website and I will continue making this website better and better.
    <br>
    I also plan on creating apps, algorithms, making something with Python(I just dont know what yet.) and doing something with Arduino(I just need a project that could be useful.) soon.
