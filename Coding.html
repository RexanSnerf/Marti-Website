        Coding is often just a hype. I am having really fun with a coding language or HTML, but after a certain time, I am bored. 
        I also need a good idea for a project, it shouldnt be useless. And I aint really creative, so I often have no idea what to do next.
        I started with <b>HTML</b> because of school. I realized it made really fun and I extended my knowlegde with tutorials.
        We continued with <b>CSS</b>, but I forgot how CSS works. I wanted to renew my HTML knowlegde, startover with css and learn <b>Java Script</b> with this project. <!--Del, alte Sachen durchstreichen, ins neue Sachen hervorheben-->
        The first time I coded was with <b>Scratch 2</b>, my best project was Pong with settings. I was really proud of myself. And yes, I made Pong, cause I dont have creativity to create
        something new by myself. After HTML and CSS we learned <b>Java</b>. My Java Editor at home is weird and I dont have any idea to create something cool with Java.
        So I didnt continued with Java at home. I wanted to make a Discord bot for my Discord server. So I watched tutorials and created one. I made it with <b>Python</b>, but I didnt
        learned much, I often just copied the code of the tutorial and changed it a little bit. I even bought a Python book in a book store. But I didnt read much of it.
        Before the quarantine time, we wanted to start with <b>Arduino</b> at school. But then came Covid-19 and we had only 1 lesson with Arduino. We only talked and made a LED blinking,
        so it wasnt much. I bought some Arduino Starter Kits and some other stuff on Amazon. Even though I dont like to give money to this fucking rich company.
        Its the only and easiest way to order something in the internet for me. In these Starter Kits were a lot of differnt sensors and actuators, but also a book and access to a PDF 
        with explanations to these different hardware parts and the coding of the software. I read this book and build the projects of the book. I usually dont really read books.
        But during this idk 8 weeks of Lockdown I read even 3 books. 1 because of school, 1 comedy book and this Arduino book. It made really fun and I continued, watched many videos
        of Arduino projects and build many projects. But I ordered a TFT Display, that doesnt really work, breadboards with to small pin holes (as example to put my Arduino Nano
        on the breadboard) and no creativity for new usefull projects. I also accidently deleted all my sketches while reinstalling my Arduino IDE. It was really frustrating at the end.
        I still have some components I didnt really used. I hadnt really fun with Arduino anymore and now I make this website. Later I coded some programs with a Python extention in 
        "Visual Studio Code", because the normal Python Setup didnt work, I had a lot of problems while installing it. I also had problems with "Visual Studio Code", 
        for example i couldnt install new libaries, but it was fun. My projects werent anything big. But I made "Rock Paper Scissors" and "Hangman" with a GUI. I was very proud of myself.
        Then I wanted to start with Arduino again and build a device that showed the temperatur. But I think I destroyed all of my sensors by connecting them wrong.
        I even burnt myself once because of that. The sensors werent working anymore or were displaying wrong temperatures. After that I wanted to build a robot with Arduino.
        I decided I want one with a camera and I searched on Amazon. But every single bot kit came from China. And I dont want to buy stuff from China and its also not so 
        environmental friendly to ship them to europe. I continue to make my website better. For example I have made the website phone compatible as good as possible.
        I added little things like shadows to the pictures. I saw a tutorial to learn animating, so I did that with the main picture on the main page. I also changed the position
        of the menu button, because it wasnt looking pretty enough. During this project many problems came up and I learned a lot. But most importantly, I had fun.
        I will continue adding Blog articles when I have something on my mind. Maybe after the election in the USA on 3rd of november. Joe Biden has to win. 
        And I think there will be chaos I could write about, when he wins or even loses. The website can be made more pretty and when I have an idea to make it better, I will do it.
