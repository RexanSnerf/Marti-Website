    Coding is often just a hype. I am having really fun with a coding language or HTML, but after a certain time, I am bored. 
    <br>
    I started with <b>HTML</b> because of school. I realized it made really fun and I extended my knowlegde with tutorials.
    <br>
    We continued with <b>CSS</b>, but I forgot how CSS works. I want to renew my HTML knowlegde, startover with css and <del>learn Python</del><ins> learn Java Script</ins> with this project. <!--Del, alte Sachen durchstreichen, ins neue Sachen hervorheben-->
    <br>
    The first time I coded was with <b>Scratch 2</b>, my best project was Pong with settings. I was really proud of myself. And yes, I made Pong, cause I dont have creativity to create
    <br>
    something new by myself. After HTML and CSS we learned <b>Java</b>. My Java Editor at home is weird and I dont have any idea to create something cool with Java.
    <br>
    So I didnt continued with Java at home. I wanted to make a Discord bot for my Discord server. So I watched tutorials and created one. I made it with <b>Python</b>, but I didnt
    <br>
    learned much, I often just copied the code of the tutorial and changed it a little bit. I even bought a python book in a book store. But I never read it lol.
    <br>
    Before the quarantine time, we wanted to start with <b>Arduino</b> at school. But then came Covid-19 and we had only 1 lesson with Arduino. We only talked and made a LED blinking,
    <br>
    so it wasnt much. I bought some Arduino Starter Kits and some other stuff on Amazon. Even though I dont like to give money to this fucking rich company.
    <br>
    Its the only and easiest way to order something in the internet for me. In these Starter Kits were a lot of differnt sensors and actuators, but also a book and access to a PDF 
    <br>
    with explanations to these different hardware parts and the coding of the software. I read this book and build the projects of the book. I usually dont really read books.
    <br>
    But during this idk 8 weeks of Lockdown I read even 3 books. 1 because of school, 1 comedy book and this Arduino book. It made really fun and I continued, watched many videos
    <br>
    of Arduino Project and build many projects. But I ordered a TFT Display, that doesnt really work, breadboards with to small pin holes (as example to put my Arduino Nano
    <br> 
    on the breadboard) and no creativity for new usefull projects. I also accidently deleted all my sketches while reinstalling my Arduino IDE. It was really frustrating at the end.
    <br> 
    I still have some components I didnt really used. I hadnt really fun with Arduino anymore and now I make this website. I even started reading my Python book, but I start with
    <br>
    Python later. I wanted to start installing everything I need for this project. But I have problems with Python. I am already frustrated. Nice. [Update 2 days later: I realized,
    <br>
    that this wouldnt work with Python, so I think I stop reading this book and use Java Script for this website.] During this projects many problems came up and I learned a lot.
    <br>
    I really enjoy coding this website and I will continue making this website better and better. 
    <br>
    I also plan on creating apps, algorithms, making something with Python(I just dont know what yet.) and doing something with Arduino(I just need a project that could be useful.).

    <br>
    I already learned of my past projects in HTML, Arduino and other programming languages that I have to name my files right. I often just saved pictures as "jadhsjdhsds" or 
    <br>
    something like this. Projects were named like "Project 1, Project 2,...". I changed this and often name my files right. I can get better everytime and I want to improve myself.
    <br>
    Mistakes and problems can be really frustrating but u learn a lot of them. I realize that my website doesnt look like a professional website. But maybe I will startover and design
    <br>
    it completly different. I found a really amazing <a href="https://theyearofgreta.com/" target="_blank">website</a> while searching for ideas for my website. It even is political and I support the message of this website. 
    <br>
    I am sure, I will never create a website as good as this website. But I want to create something like <a href="https://www.templatemonsterpreview.com/demo/51928.html" target="_blank">this</a> would be amazing. This is a huge difference when I compare it
    <br>
    with this website. I really want to make my website phone compatible next time. Also I have to better name my classes or id's. I need more structure, the order of my classes and
    <br>
    id's in my .css or .js file is really messed up sometimes. I always have to remember what a class or id is for and I have to find it easily. Everything except of the CSS code
    <br>
    for <a href="Media.html">the social media site</a> is created by myself and I dont exactly know how it works. I learn with tutorials and websites/apps that explain HTML, Java Script or CSS elements. There wasnt an explanation to the code, but I want to know how this code works and understand it very soon. I had huge problems with the like and dislike function of my memes page. 
    <br>
    First I had problems with clicking the like or dislike button and having changes. It saved the new number of likes, but I had to reload the page to see the new number of likes.
    <br>
    Then I had problems with increasing the number of likes, if I clicked the like button first and didnt changed my opinion of the memes(didnt clicked the dislike button afterwards).
    <br>
    I used "likesPic1 = likesPic1++;", "likesPic1 = likesPic1 += 1;" and "likesPic1 = likesPic1 + 1;". The last two actions just added a 1 at the end to the current number of likes.
    <br>
    Even though it doesnt with 2 or when the operator is minus. The first action just increased the number of likes on the website, but didnt saved. Then I tried it again with one of
    <br>
    the two other actions, but it never worked. After that I edited it back as it was before. But now it didnt even increased the number of likes on the website. I dont know why.
    <br>
    Sometimes everything worked fine, but after refreshing 3-5 times, it stopped working. I often thought about the variable. It could be wrong or the program thinks it is a string.
    <br>
    I just wrote "var likesPic1 = localStorage.getItem("likesPic1");", because I learned that u just write "var" in Java Script instead of the usual "int", "string", "boolean" or other types.
    <br>
    So I maked sure var "likesPic1" would be an integer and it worked. I was so happy when I solved it. I dont exactly know how long I spend on this mistake, 
    <br>
    but maybe 2-3 days / 3-7 hours. I have to design my websites in dark mode. I worked the whole time with the normal white bad design and now I designed the "Skills" site and 
    <br>
    I really like it. I dont like this light design.
