            The afro american George Floyd died during an arresting by the police. One officer knelt for 8:46 minutes on the neck of him. George said he couldnt breath, but the officer and his colleagues didnt react.
            They didnt stopped until he passed out. Afterwards many videos of it were spreading in the internet. George Floyd died later. The world is horrified and shocked.
            A discussion about police violence and racism started. Many protests all over the world erupted. Specially in the USA.
            The protestors demand police reforms and less racism in the Society. During this protests minimun 6 people died. George Floyd isnt the first black person who got killed unncessary of a police officer.
            For example "Eric Garner","Jerame Reid", "Walter Scott", "Philando Castile" and just yesterday, 20 days after the death of George Floys another black person(Rayshard Brooks) was shot unncessary.
            You can see videos of the killing on Youtube. These were just a few examples, way to many black people have been shot by police officers.
            On these protests journalists and peaceful protestors were being attacked by the police with tear gas and rubber bullets. It's not ok to shot journalists or peaceful protestors with rubber 
            bullets. Journalists have to report as close as possible. Thats their job and this job is import for the democracy. In my opinion many protestors have been shot without a good reason. In Brooklyn 
            a woman called "Dounya Zayer" was pushed to the ground and offended by a police officer without any reason. She had to went to the hospital.
            A 75 year old has been pushed to the ground by police officers in Buffalo, he was knocked out and bleeded a lot out of his head. Trump reacted to this and said, the old man acted and fell by himself.
            On 23 of august Jacob Blake has been shot 7 times in the back while walking to his car. His children watched all of it from the back of the car. Later the video of it got viral and
            protests began. Two days later a 17 year old teenager with a gun shot 3 people at a BlackLivesMatter protest who chased him and tried to disarm him. He killed two of them. He got arrested one day later.
            And what was Trump saying to this, he said the teenager was doing the right thing, they would have killed him. He defended a killer. Trump is reacting wrong on this protests, he protects the 
            police officers, tweets fake news just like almost everytime, he sends the national guards to stop these protests, clears a street with a peaceful protest just to do a weird pr photo-shooting 
            with a bible and doesnt want to make changes against racism and police violence. He is dividing the country. A lot of injuries caused of police voilence and rubber bullets. The president is doing 
            nothing, he is even protecting the voilent police officers. I know not every police officer is like this. The most of them are just doing there job. But we have to stop these few racists and stop 
            that police violence. They need reforms, changes, racism is a real problem. Racial Profiling has to stop.
