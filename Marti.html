  <br>
  This is a little website with informations about myself.
  <br>
  I was born on <b>3rd of April 2004</b> in Germany, currently I am 16 years old. My real name is Martin, but my best friend calls me sometimes Marti. And I really like. Rexan is a name from a name generator.
  <br>
  I use this name often in video games. I'm a <a href="Gaming.html">Gamer</a>, so I am single. Lol. I'm listening to <a href="musik.html">music</a> or I'm watching Youtube or Netflix while playing.
  <br>
  My political oriantation is left, I want equality, fairness, peace, less hate and much more. I like to make sport, go for a walk or ride my bike during good weather. The nature is the best place to relax in my opinion.
  <br>
  I like comedy, politics and science. My family has cats, a dog and 2 horses. I like to pet them or play with them. Sometimes I am <a href="coding.html">coding</a>. I like to be alone. So I don't have to talk to anyone. 
  <br> 
  When I am alone, I can do whatever I want, without people watching my awkward stuff, judging me or whatever. I can relax when I am alone. 
  <br>
  I felt very lonely for maybe a year and had some difficulties with loving myself. But I am more confident and self-loving today. I don't care that much anymore what people think about me, I wouldn't say I don't care. 
  <br>
  But many things I don't care about. I am doing everything I want. And I don't do stuff I dont like. Except things with my family. I often have to go to trips with my family and don't like it. But my parents force me to come with them. 
  <br>
  I hate it.
  <br>
  I chose this picture of this astronaut walking on the moon looking at the earth as my profile picture on almost every social media account. I saw it as animation in a video of "Daily Dose of Internet" and it amazed me. 
  <br>
  So I took a Screenshot of it. The picture shows in my opinion creativity and freedom. It also shows that science is import and makes fun, and this person walking alone on the moon shows me that you are the most import thing.
  <br>
  You should do, like, feel, be [and more] whatever you want. Your feelings are the most important. You shouldnt be arogant and completly dont care about others, for examples refugees or these poor families in africa.
  <br>
  I am not often very creative, but creativity and to be differnt is very import. Same as freedom. Freedom is very very important.
  <br>
  It is maybe hard to see all this differnet sides of the picture. But maybe the person who sees this picture feels same as I. I want to spread this picture and I also think it really fits to me.
