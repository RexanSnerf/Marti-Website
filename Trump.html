            On 20.01.2017 Donald J. Trump has been voted to be the 45th president of the USA. In fact his opponent Hillary Clinton had more votes, but the voting system is weird in the USA.
            Donald Trump did a lot of weird things since he became president. He tried to replace "Obamacare", but failed. He tried to stop the immigration of muslims in to the USA, but failed.
            This 2 things are wrong in my opinion, why would anyone do that lol. Trying to stop muslim immigration sounds very racist for me, maybe Trump is a racist.
            He left the Paris climate agreement, which is very bad. Its good for the oil industry in the US, but for the world it is disappointing. This big and important country is important
            to help slowing down climate change. Trump is doing 1 thing right, this is helping the industry, but with this decision he is accepting the slow death of the world we know.
            Donald Trump shut down the goverment to force the democrats to pass money for the building of a wall at the USA - Mexico border. He couldnt talk or accept his fate.
            He had to shut down the goverment. I think this is not very democratic and helpful. Its also not very democratic in my opinion to fire everyone who u dont like. Trump fired a lot of persons.
            Later many reported about his weird actions and comments. Many workers and friends of Donald Trump are also very, ehh, special. <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://youtu.be/aGwfoYeUMww">See Here.</a>
            Trump also likes to offend journalist, because they ask questions he doenst like. He often gets really mad at them. I cant talk of every time he had a fight with an journalist, but 
            often they just argue with facts and Trump doesnt want to believe these facts. This is stupid. But unfortunately he isnt the only person who thinks that way.
            Acording to FactCheck.org Trump lies 23 times a day. Thats a lot. And he is the president of the most important country in the world. This shouldnt be that way.
            The democrats thought same and started an impeachment. But mainly because he may have threatened the president of ukraine to start an investigation against Trump rival Joe Biden.
            The impeachment failed. But in my opinion (I am not a judge) there were enough evidence to impeach Trump. It failed because the democrats didnt got the two-thirds majority, because
            53 of 100 senators were republicans. And they didnt betrayed their president. I wonder why the impeachment isnt a litigation, it is a political procedure.
            Neutral judges deciding if someone gets impeached would make much more sens.

            Trump is a racist. He called Haiti and african countries "shithole countries". He called the city Baltimore with a black democratic politician a "dirty rat hole". He said to 4 female 
            black democratic politicians they should go back to where they belong. On Twitter he often tweets weird stuff, he lies a lot on Twitter and everywhere else and he posts recists and far right comments.
            For example he posted "...when the looting starts, the shooting starts." during the #BlackLivesMatter protests. But he says he is the least racist person you have ever seen. Doenst make any sens.
            Trump calls democrats often redical lefts, but they arent even radical lefts. He just like to offend his enemys. If I compare this to Germany, I would call many "AfD" members as
            radical right and maybe some members of "Die Linke" as radical lefts. But its stupid in my opinion to call members of "Die Grünen" radical lefts. Trump calling this democrats
            radical lefts is like calling "Die Grünen" members redical lefts. Its just stupid propaganda. He also called the #BlackLivesMatter protestors radical lefts and I can understand it
            a little bit, cause the looting of shops and the destroying. But almost everyone was protesting peacefully. They have to protest, they want changes, black persons are scared and 
            this shouldnt be that way. The police is way to aggressive, they arrest peaceful protesting protestors and journalists without any reason. They even shot at them without any reason.
            Just watch some YouTube videos of it. There are soo many. And this stupid president protects the voilent police officers and blames the protestors. They even build the wall
            Trump wanted, but not at the mexican border. At the White House to protect him from the protestors. Trump even hidded once in the bunker of the White House because of the protests.

            Corona is active in the whole world. Specially in the USA. Why? Because of Trumps actions. Most countries are because of low infection numbers calme. But america is still 
            not recovering after 5 months. At the beginning he maked jokes about the democrats warning the president to do more against the Corona virus. Then the Corona virus was
            spreading a lot and Trump blamed China and later Italy and Europe for it. Instead of admitting that the goverment could have done better, he blames others. He had to
            warn the citizens to wear masks and make social distancing. But they didnt. Even after 5 months everyone is still cuddeling everywhere. Trump likes to spread "Fake News"
            eventough he always says everyone who critizises him is spreading Fake News. He said once that the injection of disinfectant could be very interesting against Covid-19. 
            And light could also be very helpful to cure the virus. Both ideas are very stupid and would harm humans. It shows that he hasnt any knowledge. Trump also said 
            hydroxchloroquine would be helpful against Covid-19, because it is a "...strong and powerful medicine, but it doesnt kill people.". Guess what happend, people took that medicine and 
            2 persons died. He says many people in hospitals who are at the Corona front and himself are taking hydroxchloroquine. But it isnt proved as helpful. Instead of wating
            for a proved medicine against Corona they are already saving a medicine called "remdesivir" for months for themself. Trump really doesnt really care about corona 
            and wants to open the country up again after the lookdown. Eventough many corona infections were still taking place. Because of that and because of the not existing
            warnings of the goverment many people are outside having fun again without watching on Covid-19. Now the infection are rising even more than before.
            Then he said that the numbers of infections would be less if they wouldnt be testing that much. Which is wrong. They just wouldnt get detected.
            Trump is holding rallys for his reelection. Biden doesnt, he cares about the lives of the americans. At the rallys of Trump were signs to not use some of the chairs 
            for social distancing but Trumps workers just took them up and almost everybody didnt wear masks. I think everybody should do their best to stop the spreading of
            Covid-19, it could safe lives. Slow down the curve. Just imagine a friend of u died of Covid-19 and u could have prevented it.
            Even worse than Trump is just Bosonaro. They doesnt test anymore and Bolsonaro thinks Corona doenst exists. There isnt any protection against Corona
            and because of that many people die. Bolsonaro just doesnt care. This fachist is even worse than Trump. He is a typical far right person.
            <br>

            Trump is so incredibly wrong for this job. He is so stupid. He had soo many scandals. But nothing hurts him really. They tried to impeach him, but it didint worked cause the 
            political system is weird. He just doenst care about everything he has done. During the Corona time he totaly failed to handle the pandemic. He just blamed other countries like China,
            the european countries or the democrats for his faults and mistakes. He said by himself once "I could shot someone on the street and lose 0 voters.". This really seemed like that 
            for the last years, but Corona is hopefully saving the USA of Donald Trump.
